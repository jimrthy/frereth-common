# frereth-common

To avoid duplication among the different pieces of frereth.

Though, as it stands, it would probably make more sense to just merge
everything back into a single repository.

## Usage

    boot pom jar install

Then add ["com.frereth/common "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"] to your dependencies.

## TODO

Still need to document the actual programmatic usage.
