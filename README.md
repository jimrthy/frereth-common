# frereth-common

To avoid duplication among the different pieces of frereth.

Though, as it stands, it would probably make more sense to just merge
everything back into a single repository.

## Usage

lein install

Although you probably don't want to actually use it.

## Notes

To measure up to its name, this really should be cross-platform.

I'm not sure how realistic that would be for most of it.
